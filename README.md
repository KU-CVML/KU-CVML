# Computer Vision and Machine Learning Lab  
*Khalifa University*

Welcome to the **Computer Vision and Machine Learning Lab (CVML Lab)** at **Khalifa University**. This GitHub organization serves as a central hub for our ongoing research, development, and experimentation in various domains of computer vision and machine learning.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Objective

The main objective of the CVML Lab is to advance the state of the art in computer vision and machine learning, with a strong focus on solving real-world problems in the medical, industrial, and security sectors. We aim to develop robust algorithms, tools, and systems that contribute to academic research and have practical applications.

## ðŸ§  Core Research Topics

The lab explores a wide array of topics. Our current focus areas include:

1. **Computer Vision for Digital Pathology**  
   Developing AI-powered tools for automated diagnosis and decision support using histopathological images.

2. **Radiology Medical Image Analysis**  
   Leveraging deep learning and computer vision to interpret radiological scans (e.g., X-rays, CT, MRI) for disease detection and prognosis.

3. **Intruder Detection and Tracking in a Uniform Appearance Crowd**  
   Creating intelligent surveillance systems that detect and track anomalous movement patterns in densely crowded environments.

4. **Vision-Based Flare Analytics**  
   Applying computer vision to analyze and monitor industrial flare systems for safety and environmental compliance.

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure

This GitHub account will host multiple repositories, each focused on a specific research subproject or tool. Each repository will include detailed documentation, datasets (where applicable), and code implementations.  

Example repositories:
- `digital-pathology-analysis`
- `radiology-image-analysis`
- `intruder-tracking-crowd`
- `flare-analytics-vision`
